## Setting up Port Forwarding ##
A port forwarding needs to be set up on the router
Name: -> the name you want to give this rule
Internal Port: -> the port the server is listening | use command: sudo netstat -plnt
External Port: -> what port do you want to use to listen externally 
(http:// request assume you requesting port 80 [if not specified]. https:// requests assume port 443)
Protocol: -> Both would do
IP Address: -> internal IP address of the device | use command: ifconfig (look for inet of wlan0 section)

!! Please Note: External IP is not accessible within local network. You need to use Internal IP to access it !!

## Setting up DDNS (Dynamic DNS) ##
You'll need to set up DDNS. Two major providers:
* DynDNS - available on more devices, paid
* No-IP - free, chose to use this DDNS
Once you signed up, enter your information into DDNS section of your router
